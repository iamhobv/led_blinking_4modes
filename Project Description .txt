Excited to share a recent project

â—¾ IDEA of project:
There are 8 yellow LEDs and a (On/Off) magic button to turn the LEDs on/off, as well as an indicator blue LED to indicate whether the system is turned on or off. When the system is turned on, there are 5 modes for the LEDs with buttons (0,1,2,3,4) on the keypad.
